EXTREME TRADING SOLUTION: Quantum-accelerated trading strategies on Accelerated Algorithmic Trading (AAT) Framework

## 1-1 Project Abstraction
Quantum Bifurcation Machines can be used for quantum adiabatic optimization and universal quantum computation. TOSHIBA has realized Quantum Bifurcation Machines to Simulated Bifurcation Machine（SBM）Technologies accelerated with NVIDIA GPU.
We design and implement Quantum-accelerated Trading Strategies for currency exchange with replaceable algorithms modular（e.g. Simulated Bifurcation, SB or Simulated Quantum Annealing, SQA）on Xilinx Accelerated Algorithmic Trading (AAT) framework, which is a Fully featured open source reference design for trading applications.
